# Simple Area Price Linear Regression Model

This is a small project that aims to predict the price of houses using linear regression analysis. 

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of houses based on certain features. Linear regression is chosen as the predictive model due to its simplicity and interpretability.

The project follows these main steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathering the primary dataset containing relevant information about houses and their prices.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring the dataset to gain insights and visualize the relationships between variables.
3. Model Training: Building a linear regression model using scikit-learn library and fitting it to the prepared data.
4. Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.


## Tech Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementing the project.
- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental library for scientific computing in Python.
- **Matplotlib**: A data visualization library for creating various types of plots and charts.
- **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library providing tools for regression analysis and model training.


## Dataset

The primary dataset used for this project should contain information about houses, such as the size, number of bedrooms, location, etc., as well as the corresponding prices. Ensure the dataset is in a structured format, such as a CSV file, for easy ingestion and preprocessing.
